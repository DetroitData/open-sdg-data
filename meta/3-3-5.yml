  <p>NTDs are formally recognized as targets for global action in SDG target
  3.3, which calls to &#x201C;end the epidemics of ... neglected tropical
  diseases&#x201D; by 2030, as part of Goal 3 (Ensure healthy lives and ensure
  well-being for all at all ages). Successful interventions against NTDs
  contribute to meeting other SDGs, such as alleviating poverty (Goal 1) and
  hunger (Goal 2), enabling people to pursue an education (Goal 4) and lead
  productive working lives (Goal 8) and promoting equality, for example with
  regard to gender (Goals 5 and 10). Progress towards other Goals can accelerate
  the achievement of NTD goals. For example, wider provision of clean water,
  sanitation and hygiene (WASH) (Goal 6) is believed to help to eliminate or
  control NTDs; the availability of resilient infrastructure (Goal 9) should
  facilitate delivery of medicines and outreach to remote communities; the goals
  of sustainable cities (Goal 11) and climate action (Goal 13) can support the
  environmental management necessary for control of disease vectors. Attaining
  all SDGs and NTD goals is founded on strong global partnerships (Goal 17).</p>
