  ## Definition:
  
  The maternal mortality ratio (MMR) is defined as the number of maternal deaths 
  during a given time period per 100,000 live births during the same period. It depicts 
  the risk of meternal death relative to the number of live births and essentially 
  captures the risk of death in a single pregnanct (proxied by a single live birth.
  
  ## Concepts:
  
  **Maternal death:** The death of a woman while pregnant or within 42 days of termination of pregnancy,
  irrespective of the duration and site of pregnancy, 
  from any cause related to or aggravated by the pregnancy or its management (from direct or indirect obstetric death), 
  but not from unintentional or incidental death. 

  **A death occuring during pregnancy, childbirth and puerperium (also know as pregnancy-related death):** 
  The death of a woman while pregnant or withing 42 days of termination of pregnanct, irrespective of the cause of 
  death.
  
  
UNIT_MEASURE: >- Maternal deaths per 100,000 live births

CLASS_SYSTEM: >- Maternal deaths are classified according to the International statistical classification of diseases and related health problems (ICD) definition. 
**The specific codes used under the ICD-10 (the 10th revision of the ICD) to define a maternal death are:** O00-O96; O98, O99 and A34. 

ICD-11 (the 11th revision of the ICD) was adopted by the World Health Assemby in May 2019 and comes into effect on 1st January 2022. Further information is avalible at www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/  
The coding rules related to meternal mortality are being edited to fully match the new structure of the ICD 11, 
at https://icd.who.int . Forthcoming releases from 2022 onward will transition to use the ICD 11 coding
